What is Interpolation in Terraform?

Interpolation is the method used to dynamically reference values within Terraform configuration blocks. It allows us to extract and manipulate variables efficiently.

What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source tool that enables us to automate infrastructure across multiple cloud providers by writing declarative scripts.

Terraform vs. Ansible – What’s the Difference?

Both are IaC tools, but their purposes are different:

* Terraform provisions (creates) infrastructure.
* Ansible is mainly used for configuration management, software installation, and updates.

Terraform vs. AWS CloudFormation

* CloudFormation is AWS-specific and relies on predefined templates for infrastructure deployment.
* Terraform, on the other hand, is cloud-agnostic, means it works across multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
